## chrwiseSignatures to analyze signature interactions

The package provides several functions to calculate mutational signature interaction metrics. 

* `cor_coda` - pearson correlations based on compositional data analysis
* `cooccurrence` - co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity based on Fisher's exact test
* `bcmi` - Bias-corrected Mutual Information from mpmi package
* `cor_sigs` - Spearman or Pearson correlations 

The package also provides a set of functions to produce summary interaction networks based.

Check  the documentation of function `plot_interaction_networks` to see how plotting works.
